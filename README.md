Step Counter on DE1-SoC (Embedded Linux + ADXL345 + MMIO):

A simple step-counter demo on the Terasic DE1-SoC developement board that runs on the HPS (ARM) under embedded Linux.
It reads acceleration data from the on-board ADXL345 accelerometer over I2C, performs lightweight filtering + threshold step detection in C, and writes the live step count to the FPGA-connected LEDs via memory-mapped I/O (/dev/mem).

Highlights:

Embedded Linux user-space I2C access via /dev/i2c-0 (linux/i2c-dev.h)
ADXL345 configuration + multi-byte reads (X/Y/Z)
Simple step detection using magnitude of acceleration vector, exponential moving average baseline (high-pass style), and threshold + minimum time between steps
HPS -> FPGA communication using lightweight bridge MMIO
Project Files:

read_mpu.c — quick sensor reader/validator (prints raw X/Y/Z)
step_detector.c — step detection via MMIO
mmio.h — helper functions for mapping physical memory (/dev/mem)
address_map_arm.h — DE1-SoC lightweight bridge + peripheral offsets
Makefile — builds both binaries
Note: Despite the filename read_mpu.c, the sensor used is ADXL345, not an MPU. I was too lazy to change it.

Requirements:

Hardware / OS:

Terasic DE1-SoC
Embedded Linux running on HPS
I2C enabled and ADXL345 accessible on /dev/i2c-0
Software:

GCC toolchain on target (or cross-compile)
Permissions to access /dev/i2c-0 and /dev/mem
Outputs: read_mpu, step_detector

Run:

Read accelerometer values (sanity check) sudo ./read_mpu Expected startup message includes: ADXL345 DEVID = 0xE5 Then it prints raw readings: AX= ... AY= ... AZ= ...

Run step detector (prints live debug + updates LEDs) sudo ./step_detector

Behavior:

increments step counter when dynamic acceleration exceeds threshold
writes step_count to LEDR via MMIO
prints debug lines like: -steps=... mag=... base=... dyn=... (x=... y=... z=...)
Stop with:

Ctrl+C
How Step Detection Works (high level):

Read raw X/Y/Z from ADXL345
Convert to g’s using a scale factor
Compute magnitude: sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)
Track a slow-moving baseline (EMA)
Use the dynamic component: dyn = mag - baseline
Count a step when:
dyn > THRESHOLD_G
at least MIN_INTERVAL_MS since last step (debounce)
Tunable parameters (in step_detector.c):

FILTER_ALPHA
THRESHOLD_G
MIN_INTERVAL_MS
Safety / Notes:

/dev/mem mapping is powerful; only map the needed span and run on trusted images. This is a teaching/demo implementation (not a production pedometer algorithm). This was done to be an introduction for a future project.
